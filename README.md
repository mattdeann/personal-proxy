## Beat Cors Server
This project is an example of how to set up a proxy server to serve a front end when CORS is not allowing resource sharing for whatever reason (usually back end is set up to serve specified clients). Forked from David Katz boilerplate, it is being utilized when needed

### Run the server
```
npm i
npm run start
```

### Visit 
`localhost:3000/`.
